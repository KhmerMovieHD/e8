[Iroh] The wall is impenetrable

The surrounding cliffs are hundreds

I know you think I'm being reckless,
but Zhao has cornered the Avatar,

and he's not gonna stop
until he has him, so neither can I.

One way or another,
this is where my journey ends.

53

Search the coastline for fissures,

from the city.

Just forget about engaging them at sea.

00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,917
Even with all of your benders
on all of your boats,

66
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,321
their numbers are just too great.

67
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:30,542
Then we make our stand here.

68
00:04:31,042 --> 00:04:32,167
How far away are they?

69
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:35,125
They'll probably be in range
in an hour. Two, tops.

70
00:04:36,958 --> 00:04:38,458
We need to call the patrols home.

[Iroh] Forgive me, Admiral,
but I'm confused.

00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:19,417
You're wondering why
the command ship isn't leading the attack.

83
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,625
It does seem an unusual strategy.

84
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:24,750
Weren't you the one who pointed out
a frontal assault on the Waterbenders

85
00:05:24,833 --> 00:05:25,958
would be fruitless?

86
00:05:26,042 --> 00:05:27,042
Well, yes, but...

87
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:29,875
So it would make sense
to attack on multiple fronts.

88
00:05:31,375 --> 00:05:33,917
Open a new front? With one ship?

89
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:37,958
One ship, but not one vessel.

Oh, this isn't our work.

No, this comes courtesy
of our spies in Omashu.

This is just a prototype.

96
00:05:52,625 --> 00:05:56,083
Even if you use this
to bypass Agna Qel'a's main defenses,

97
00:05:56,167 --> 00:05:59,625
it's far too small to carry
any kind of significant fighting force.

that victory doesn't always depend
on the numbers,

Pakku, what good is it relying on the past
when it stops us from having a future?

You can help them repair the damage

if anything should happen to me,

you must take over.

167
00:10:01,708 --> 00:10:04,542
[Iroh] Admiral, the Waterbenders
draw their strength from the moon,

168
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:08,792
and on a night like tonight,
their powers will be at their peak.

169
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:12,042
I suggest you pause the attack
until daybreak.

170
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:14,875
No.

171
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:19,167
I have been studying up
on matters beyond this realm,

172
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:23,083
which is why I know
that that isn't just any moon.

173
00:10:23,167 --> 00:10:24,875
It's the Ice Moon,

174
00:10:24,958 --> 00:10:26,750
a rare cosmic event.

175
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:31,125
The barriers between
the physical and spirit worlds

176
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:35,250
grow thin… on this night.

177
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:40,708
When I received the Fire Lord's orders
to conquer the North,

178
00:10:40,792 --> 00:10:43,333
I knew brute force wasn't gonna be enough.

179
00:10:43,417 --> 00:10:46,000
I needed an edge.

180
00:10:46,083 --> 00:10:48,208
[suspenseful music swells]

181
00:10:49,417 --> 00:10:50,583
Nothing.

182
00:10:50,667 --> 00:10:53,333
Just a bunch of mumbo jumbo
about lion turtles

183
00:10:53,417 --> 00:10:56,958
and cosmic balance and push and pull.

184
00:10:57,042 --> 00:11:00,083
And yet there is wisdom
to be gleaned from the old tales.

185
00:11:02,417 --> 00:11:08,125
Agna Qel'a… is built on the site
of the ancestral home of the water tribe,

186
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,125
an oasis deep in the ice

187
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:15,750
that provided warmth and nourishment
for their people in the harsh environment.

188
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,500
It was from this oasis

189
00:11:18,583 --> 00:11:20,917
that the tribe looked up to the sky

190
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,958
and learned to waterbend

191
00:11:23,667 --> 00:11:26,708
by watching the moon
push and pull the tides.

192
00:11:27,958 --> 00:11:30,458
And so the Waterbenders believe

193
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,750
their lives come from
the spirit of the ocean,

194
00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:38,667
while their powers come from
the spirit of the moon.

195
00:11:40,667 --> 00:11:43,792
These same spirits
give up their immortality

196
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:47,542
for one night every year
to be among the Waterbenders.

197
00:11:48,167 --> 00:11:52,708
They take physical form
and become part of the mortal world.

198
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:56,708
They appear in this world?

My knife is near. I can sense it.

Knife?

214
00:12:44,667 --> 00:12:47,625
One created with materials
from the Spirit World.

215
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:52,333
And if it has returned to the North,
it can only mean one thing.

Of course not.

218
00:12:58,583 --> 00:12:59,917
Killing the ocean spirit

219
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,500
would deprive Waterbenders
around the world of their lives.

No.

I'm only gonna kill the moon.

224
00:13:14,417 --> 00:13:18,333
Zhao cannot be allowed to meddle
with the primal forces of nature.

225
00:13:18,417 --> 00:13:22,125
In doing so, he will throw
the entire world out of balance.

226

The Avatar's power is great,

Zhao,

329
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:27,500
the power of the spirits
is not to be trifled with.

330
00:20:28,042 --> 00:20:30,958
Without the moon,
the world will be thrown out of balance,

331
00:20:31,042 --> 00:20:32,708
and chaos will be unleashed.

332
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:34,917
Even Ozai wouldn't want that.

333
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:36,875
Ozai lacks vision.

334
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:40,458
He's so fixated on the games
he's playing with his family,

335
00:20:40,542 --> 00:20:42,750
he can't see the bigger picture.

336
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:48,333
Zhao, whatever you do to that spirit,
I'll unleash on you tenfold!

337
00:20:48,917 --> 00:20:50,458
Spare me your empty threats.

338
00:20:51,292 --> 00:20:53,542
This can still work out for you, Iroh.

339
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:58,458
Once I take my place as the new Fire Lord,
you can stand by my side.

340
00:20:58,542 --> 00:21:01,958
Your presence
will lend legitimacy to my claim.

341
00:21:02,917 --> 00:21:06,000
The Dragon of the West can rise again.

342
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:11,208
As long as he bows…

343

[Aang] Zhao!

You're too late, Avatar.

352
00:21:49,292 --> 00:21:50,583
Zhao, don't.

353
00:21:54,042 --> 00:21:57,000
No matter what you think,
this isn't power.

354
00:21:57,083 --> 00:21:57,917
[Zhao] No?

355
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,375
Do you realize what I can do?

356
00:22:00,458 --> 00:22:04,292
I can wipe out an entire race of benders.

357
00:22:04,375 --> 00:22:06,500
Can you imagine what that's like?

358
00:22:08,125 --> 00:22:09,125
Yes.

359
00:22:10,167 --> 00:22:11,167
I can.

360
00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:16,000
You wanna rule the world,
but if you do this,

361
00:22:16,083 --> 00:22:17,750
there won't be a world to rule.

362
00:22:18,250 --> 00:22:23,750
So release the spirit,
and I'll go with you… peacefully.

363

How much of a threat will the Avatar be
once I eliminate waterbending

Let's face it. You don't matter anymore.

Thank you.

Yue, what are you doing?

555
00:37:47,458 --> 00:37:51,792
I was touched by the moon spirit
as a child, so I have its life within me.

556
00:37:53,625 --> 00:37:55,375
It's time for me to give it back.

557
00:37:57,583 --> 00:37:59,458
This isn't a sad thing.

558
00:38:02,167 --> 00:38:06,250
Do you know why the ocean and moon spirits

559
00:38:06,333 --> 00:38:08,167
take physical form for a night?

560
00:38:09,417 --> 00:38:12,292
It's because they wanna know
what it is to be mortal.

561
00:38:13,917 --> 00:38:16,500
It's worth the risk to be alive.

562
00:38:19,583 --> 00:38:21,167
Even for just one night.

563
00:38:25,375 --> 00:38:27,000

listen to me.

I know you think
you don't belong in this world,

My daughter always made her own choices.

And that was not something you

Me…

I watched it happen.

607
00:43:28,333 --> 00:43:32,667
I stood on the sidelines
while others fought and died,

608
00:43:32,750 --> 00:43:34,708
being the warrior I could never be.

609
00:43:35,667 --> 00:43:39,458
Sokka, in a moment
when she must have been scared,

610
00:43:40,625 --> 00:43:42,458
you made sure she wasn't alone.

611
00:43:44,667 --> 00:43:46,500
You don't have to be a warrior

612
00:43:47,042 --> 00:43:48,542
to be a hero.

613
00:43:57,458 --> 00:43:59,833
I thought I'd never see
the light of a new day,

614
00:44:00,708 --> 00:44:04,625
but the sun rises,
and the water tribe is still here.

615
00:44:05,917 --> 00:44:07,167
So much was lost.

616
00:44:07,833 --> 00:44:12,417
Yes, but we'll rebuild,
and we'll emerge stronger.

617
00:44:15,083 --> 00:44:19,708
Do you remember how I told you
water is the element of change?

618
00:44:20,667 --> 00:44:23,417
I'd forgotten what that truly meant.

619
00:44:24,125 --> 00:44:27,875
Change is the key to new life.

620
00:44:30,208 --> 00:44:31,708
You reminded me of that,

621
00:44:33,583 --> 00:44:35,792
and I'm deeply grateful that you did.

622
00:44:40,667 --> 00:44:45,292
You know, there's a whole new generation
of Waterbenders who will need training.

623
00:44:47,625 --> 00:44:49,042
We could use your help.

Thanks.

625
00:44:55,833 --> 00:44:59,208
But Aang still has a journey to complete,
and so do I.

626
00:45:01,125 --> 00:45:03,417
After all, the Avatar
still has to learn waterbending.

627
00:45:06,250 --> 00:45:10,417
In that case, he couldn't have asked
for a better master.

628
00:45:14,458 --> 00:45:16,292
Hmm. For you.

629
00:45:18,625 --> 00:45:19,875
What is it?

630
00:45:20,417 --> 00:45:23,125
Water from our oasis.

anytime.

Lieutenant Jee would have known
to stay out of the worst of the battle.

636
00:45:54,583 --> 00:45:57,083
He and the crew
may be looking for us right now.

What do you think, Prince Zuko?

638
00:46:03,542 --> 00:46:04,958
What do you want to do?

639
00:46:08,417 --> 00:46:09,417
I don't know.

640
00:46:14,625 --> 00:46:15,625
I'm tired.

641
00:46:20,042 --> 00:46:21,375
Then you should rest.

642
00:46:22,667 --> 00:46:24,292
A man needs his rest.

643
00:46:39,417 --> 00:46:41,417
[dramatic music playing]

644
00:46:49,500 --> 00:46:50,667
I caused this.

645
00:46:51,208 --> 00:46:53,333
No, the Fire Nation did.

646
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:56,000
Because I failed to be the Avatar.

647
00:46:57,292 --> 00:46:59,958
How do I do this
without causing so much pain?

648
00:47:01,167 --> 00:47:02,625
Aang, this is war.

649
00:47:03,375 --> 00:47:05,792
There's going to be losses.
There's going to be pain.

650
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:08,542
None of that is your fault.

651
00:47:08,625 --> 00:47:10,333
And the Firebenders aren't giving up.

652
00:47:10,417 --> 00:47:13,208
We have to prepare
for whatever they throw at us next.

653
00:47:13,292 --> 00:47:15,000
And so stop worrying about the past,

654
00:47:15,083 --> 00:47:17,208
and start thinking about
what you still have to do.

[emotional music playing]

656
00:47:32,667 --> 00:47:35,750
I think I understand something
Gyatso was trying to tell me.

657
00:47:36,583 --> 00:47:40,750
He told me let go of the past,
or I'll never have a future.

658
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,000
That's right.

659
00:47:51,083 --> 00:47:54,167
You're gonna learn waterbending,
and I'm gonna make sure of that.

660
00:47:54,250 --> 00:47:55,833
And then earthbending…

661
00:47:55,917 --> 00:47:57,417
Which means back to Omashu.

662
00:48:03,750 --> 00:48:04,875
[Sokka] So,

663
00:48:06,042 --> 00:48:07,042
anyone else hungry?

664
00:48:07,625 --> 00:48:09,667
Why is everything
always about your stomach?

665
00:48:09,750 --> 00:48:13,292
- Because that's where his brain is.
- Oh, says the kid with the melon head.

666
00:48:13,958 --> 00:48:15,458
[Katara] Ooh, I could go for a melon.

667
00:48:15,542 --> 00:48:18,292
[Sokka] See?
Food is always the right answer.

668
00:48:19,250 --> 00:48:20,750
Just gotta listen to Sokka.

669
00:48:23,167 --> 00:48:25,417
[Great Sage] <i>Agna Qel'a took heavy damage,</i>

670
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:28,000
but our forces were unable
to take the city.

671
00:48:30,667 --> 00:48:34,792
Also, it seems
the Avatar remains alive and free.

672
00:48:37,542 --> 00:48:38,542
Pity.

673
00:48:40,625 --> 00:48:41,750
But not unexpected.

674
00:48:44,083 --> 00:48:46,958
Conquering the North
was always an unlikely proposition.

675
00:48:50,042 --> 00:48:53,542
If that was the case,
then why attack the North at all?

676
00:48:55,833 --> 00:48:57,083
Distraction.

677
00:48:58,958 --> 00:49:01,208
The North was never the true target.

678
00:49:06,958 --> 00:49:07,958
[grunts]

679
00:49:09,417 --> 00:49:11,417
<i>For the first time in a century,</i>

680
00:49:11,958 --> 00:49:14,042
<i>Omashu is ours.</i>

681
00:49:15,208 --> 00:49:18,083
<i>Now only Ba Sing Se stands between us</i>

682
00:49:18,583 --> 00:49:21,208
<i>and the total conquest
of the Earth Kingdom.</i>

683
00:49:26,708 --> 00:49:29,000
[Bumi grunting]

684
00:49:30,375 --> 00:49:31,750
A brilliant strategy,

685
00:49:32,833 --> 00:49:34,875
but was the Fire Lord aware

686
00:49:34,958 --> 00:49:37,875
Prince Zuko was among
the forces at Agna Qel'a?

687
00:49:39,958 --> 00:49:42,917
The loss of life among our troops
was substantial.

688
00:49:43,750 --> 00:49:45,750
[suspenseful music playing]

689
00:49:51,667 --> 00:49:54,000
If Zuko is strong, he'll survive.

690
00:49:56,333 --> 00:49:57,333
If not…

691
00:50:00,125 --> 00:50:02,625
sometimes you have to sacrifice the weak

692
00:50:03,125 --> 00:50:05,167
<i>to keep yourself strong.</i>

693
00:50:11,625 --> 00:50:12,625
Omashu

694
00:50:13,750 --> 00:50:14,958
is ours!

695
00:50:15,458 --> 00:50:17,542
[dramatic music playing]

696
00:50:17,625 --> 00:50:19,625
[pounding continues]

697
00:50:25,625 --> 00:50:27,083
For the Fire Nation!

698
00:50:27,167 --> 00:50:28,750
[soldier] Fire Nation!

699
00:50:28,833 --> 00:50:30,542
[soldiers cheering]

700
00:50:34,792 --> 00:50:35,792
So…

701
00:50:37,833 --> 00:50:39,125
what's next?

702
00:50:39,208 --> 00:50:40,708
[flames crackling]

703
00:50:46,958 --> 00:50:50,333
[Great Sage] Measuring the movements of
the heavens has always proven difficult,

704
00:50:50,833 --> 00:50:54,833
but we have devised a method
to better understand celestial motion.

705
00:50:55,542 --> 00:50:57,458
[clicking]

706
00:51:02,375 --> 00:51:04,333
It's taken a hundred years,

707
00:51:04,917 --> 00:51:07,083
but the time finally draws near.

708
00:51:09,042 --> 00:51:10,750
- When?
- [Great Sage] Soon.

709
00:51:17,583 --> 00:51:19,583
We shall see the return

710
00:51:20,958 --> 00:51:23,042
of Sozin's Comet.

711
00:51:23,125 --> 00:51:27,833
[suspenseful music swells]

712
00:51:29,542 --> 00:51:31,458
[upbeat drum and flute music playing]
